    <p>These instructions show you how to add pictures into your project.</p>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>
    <p>When choosing pictures, it is important to make sure that you have permission to use it, and it is always a good idea to thank whoever created it (if it does not belong to you), for example with a link to the website!</p>
    <p>By using the link below to search for pictures, you will make sure that you only find images that are <strong>Copyright Free</strong>, so you have permission to use them for education purposes.</p>
    <p><a href="https://search.kidzsearch.com/kzimagesearch-copyright-free.php?q=computer&aff=&subid=&oq=computer&v=desktop#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=computer&gsc.page=1" target="_blank">Image Search</a></p>
    <p>If you want to create a project to share online with people other than your family, you will need to be even more careful about how you choose your images.</p>
    <p><strong>Remember, do not include any photos of yourself or anyone you know in your app, as the information stored on App Lab is not private or secure!</strong></p>

    <h3>Getting a link to your pictures</h3>
    <p>You can create an image yourself, using software on your device, or save an image to your computer after <a href="https://search.kidzsearch.com/kzimagesearch-copyright-free.php?q=computer&aff=&subid=&oq=computer&v=desktop#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=computer&gsc.page=1" target="_blank">searching online</a>.</p>
    <p>App Lab does not allow you to directly place images into your app - you need to link to them.</p>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://imgbb.com/upload" target="_blank">imgbb</a> and upload your picture. Choose how long you want to keep the picture for, then click <strong>Upload</strong>.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Once the image has successfully uploaded (this might take a little while if it is a large picture!), click on the image to open the viewer window.</p>
    <img src=".\images\picture-click.PNG" alt="click on picture screenshot" width="800px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Right click on the image, and select <strong>Copy image address</strong> to save the correct link - you can now use this link in your app!</p>
